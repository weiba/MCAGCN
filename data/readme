The SNP genetic data we used comes from ADNI (https://ida.loni.usc.edu/explore/jsp/search/search.jsp?project=ADNI). The quality control and preprocessing steps for SNP genetic data are detailed in Section 2.2 "Data Processing" of our paper. We have provided four dataset files corresponding to four classification tasks, and you can access the SNP genetic data by loading the .npz data files and retrieving the gene_codes variable.
